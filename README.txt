Features
========

    * Powerful *command-line interface*

    * Assertion-based *tests - no ugly failUnless*, failIf*, etc. methods

    * Tree-based test structure for better fixture management

    * Built-in *coverage analysis* and *profiling*

    * No implicit instantiation of test suites

Requirements
=========

Two iterations of pry exist, one built for the Python 2.5 releases (2.5.2 and higher) and another for Python 3.0. Otherwise, pry requires:

        * tinytree

The documentation can be converted to html using open source tools

        * cubictemp
        * countershape

Documentation
========

Documentation and a basic guide with sample source code is provided
with the source distribution.

The documentation is at  ./doc-src and the example files
at ./examples.
